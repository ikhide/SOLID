# SOLID

## Single Responsibility Principle

This means that every software component (Class, method) should have one reason to change.
This also means that every software component should have only one responsibility.

`Cohesion`: This is the degree to which various parts of a software component are related.
`Coupling`: This is the level of interdependency between various software components

## Open Closed Principle

Software components should be open for extension but closed for modification. Meaning if you want to add a new feature or extend the functionality of a class, you shouldnâ€™t have to rewrite previously existing code.
