# SOLID

## Single Responsibility Principle

This means that every software component (Class, method) should have one reason to change.
This also means that every software component should have only one responsibility.

`Cohesion`: This is the degree to which various parts of a software component are related.

`Coupling`: This is the level of interdependency between various software components.

## Open Closed Principle

Software components should be open for extension but closed for modification. Meaning if you want to add a new feature or extend the functionality of a class, you shouldn’t have to rewrite previously existing code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

“Tell, don’t ask” - This rule stipulates that you substitute the implementation of one function with another. Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.
